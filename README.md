# Chuhan Zhang

Robotics researcher working on embodied intelligence for legged robot locomotion. Currently applying for graduate programs in Robotics starting Fall 2026.

## Research

My research focuses on dynamic modeling, control systems, and learning-based approaches for energy-efficient legged locomotion. Current projects include:

- **Energy-Recycling Bipedal Walker** (ICRA 2026, Under Review) - Designed spring-clutch mechanism achieving 60% reduction in transport cost
- **Aero-OMEGA Hopping Robot** (BioRob/IROS 2026, In Preparation) - Hierarchical control and reinforcement learning for robust terrain adaptation

## Education

**B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics**  
Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (China)  
Expected Graduation: October 2026  
Core GPA: 90.4/100.0

## Achievements
