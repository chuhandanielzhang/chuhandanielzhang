# Legged_Robot_Clutch&Spring

Energy-recycling mechanism for legged locomotion using lockable clutch to improve walking efficiency.

## Overview

Foot-ground collisions in legged locomotion cause significant energy loss. While spring-like compliant mechanisms can reduce dissipation, their passive timing often mismatches the gait cycle, undermining both efficiency and stability. This work proposes an energy-recycling rimless wheel that uses a lockable clutch to store energy at foot contact and reinject it in the next gait cycle.

## Key Results

- **Energy reduction**: Up to 16.13% compared to viscoelastic-legged configuration
- **Stability**: Strong and consistent stability across a range of slope angles
- **Experimental validation**: Achieved Cost of Transport (CoT) of 0.02 on 1° slope
